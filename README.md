# Descentral Contraptions
## Overview
Comprehensive applications built with the LibP2P and IPFS libraries in Javascript. The playground has a collection of [apps](/apps) that are ripe for exploring. Get wild and start your journey in decentralized web dev here!

## Setting Up
1. Clone or fork this repository
2. At the root level, run this command to install node packages

***LibP2P should now be enabled for all current and upcoming apps***

## Creating your own App
1. Produce a new directory in [apps](/apps). Give it the name of your shiny new project
2. Update the apps README to include the name and description of your app
3. Including a README inside your app directory to guide developers in setting up and launching your app is strongly encouraged
